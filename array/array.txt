array
what is array?
------------------
-> Array is special type of variable in which we can store multiple values of SAME DATATYPE.
-> We can access specific value { element } as well as change { update } specific value in array.
-> To change, access any value in array we have to use arrayName and its  position known as index which start from 0 and ends on (size - 1), where size is the number of elements stored in an array 
we can change (increse/decrease) size of the array. 
-> we must give datatype of the array when we create array. 

how to create array 
datatype arrayName[size]; OR, 
datatype arrayName[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            index :     0  1  2  3  4 

example 
int marks[14];
float floatArray = {1.0, 2.5, 3.7, 4.2, 5.9};


how to store value into array 
--------------------------------------
example 

scanf("%d", &marks[0]); // taking input 
printf("first subject mark = %d", marks[0]); // printing value of marks[0] -> first element
marks[0] = 100; // updating first element

int index = 0;
printf("first subject mark = %d",marks[index]); // accessing a element by using a variable

there are mainly two type of array 
single dimensional array -> 1D array
two dimensional array -> 2D array
